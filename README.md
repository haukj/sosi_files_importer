# SosiImporter4Blender
Importer for SOSI files (containing 3D model data) used for geographical information in Norway.

This is an addon for Blender to allow imports of SOSI files (with extension .sos). This addon is intended to handle the data normally contained in so-called 
"digital maps" available from Norwegian municipal og governmental services.

The add-on was originally written in C++ for Sketchup under 64-bit Windows 10. For Blender the C++ code is compiled into a DLL and called from Python.
